# NetCDF Benchmark Tool

## Introduction
NetCDF Performance Benchmark Tool (NetCDF-Bench) was developed to measure NetCDF performance on devices ranging from notebooks to large HPC systems. It mimics the typical I/O behavior of scientific climate applications and captures the performance on each node/process. In the end, it aggregates the data to human readable summary. 

We assume, that a typical scientific application runs on several nodes and several processes on each node. (To be done ...).

NetCDF-Bench is parallel bechmark. It supports independent I/O, collective I/O and chunked I/O modes. If necessary, it can pre-fill the variables with some value. 

## Domain decomposition
NetCDF-Bench supports various access patterns on a 4D dataset (one time dimension and three data dimensions). The short notation of the geometry is `(t:x:y:z)`, e.g., `(10:1000:1000:500)`.

The pictures shows an example of data with geometry `(3:6:4:3)`.

### Data size vs. Block size
The data is written in blocks to the shared file. The block size can be customized, but there are some restrictions. Assume, that
* `t:x:y:z` is the data size
* `t` is a multiple of some integer value `s`
* `nn` is the number of nodes
* `ppn` the number of processes per node
* `px` and `py` are integer values, that satisfies the condition: `px · py = nn · ppn`

Then `(s:x/px:y/py:z)` is a valid block size. (Default block size is `(1:x/nn:y/ppn:z)`.)

Each process allocates `(s:x/px:y/py:z) * type_size` memory space.

The data is read/written in timesteps.

## Usage
NetCDF-Bench is designed in that way that it can run without any parameters, but for advanced usage our tool provides a number of parameters.

```

```

## Example output
NetCDF-Bench aggregates the result of all processes and creates a summary. Here is an example output:

## On-going work
We plan to extend the tool with the following features. 
1. Drop caches - Cached data can influence the results of I/O performance, therefore it must be cleared before benchmark runs. This features must run in user space.
2. Compression - This feature is useful to benchmark the NetCDF compression, but also for people who are working on new compression methods.
3. CSV output - Detailed information about the benchmark run for analysis with third party tools.
